    \item \textbf{Authentication:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Identify the user,
        \item Validate the user,
        \item Allow/Disallow user based upon credentials.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Authorization:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Have defined levels of allowed operations/tasks divided into groups,
        \item Validate user-to-groups relations,
        \item Allow/Disallow user actions.
        \item On network gear the Allow/Disallowed actions can be stored on either the central AAA server or locally\footnote{May not apply to all network gear} in the network node.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accounting:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Network nodes collect user and session information from start to end when connecting to a node,
        \item All information is transferred back to AAA server,
        \item Transferred info can be leveraged for several purposes. Typically logged info is:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item session duration,
            \item user commands,
            \item disallowed commands
